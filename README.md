## üìñ About This Repository

This repository is a comprehensive guide and resource collection to help you turn your unused internet bandwidth into a reliable passive income stream. It focuses on legitimate, verified platforms that pay you to securely share your connection.

Your Wi-Fi or ethernet connection sits idle most of the time. These services allow you to safely "rent out" that unused capacity to verified companies for business tasks, and you get paid in return.

## üí° How It Works

The concept is incredibly simple:

1.  **Sign Up:** You create an account on one or more of the platforms below.
2.  **Install:** You download and install their secure application on your devices (PC, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, Android smartphone...).
3.  **Share:** The app runs quietly in the background, using a small portion of your unused bandwidth to route traffic through your IP address.
4.  **Get Paid:** You are compensated based on the amount of data (in GB) you share and the time you are connected.

> **üîí Is This Safe?**
> Yes. These reputable services do not access, monitor, or collect any of your personal data. All traffic is encrypted. Your connection is only used as a "gateway" (proxy) for pre-approved business use cases.

## ‚ùì What Is Your Bandwidth *Actually* Used For?

You aren't sharing your connection for nothing. Vetted business clients pay these platforms to access residential IP addresses (like yours) to perform legitimate tasks that require a "real" user's perspective:

* **üìä Price Comparison:** Checking flight, hotel, or e-commerce prices from different regions.
* **üåê SEO & SERP:** Analyzing search engine results (like Google's) from various locations to optimize their web presence.
* **üîé Ad Verification:** Ensuring their advertisements are displaying correctly in different countries and are not being used for fraud.
* **üåç Content Delivery:** Testing website and app performance, or ensuring their content is accessible from different geographies.

## üåü Top RecommendedPlatforms (My Picks)

These are the services I personally use and recommend. They are reliable, pay on time, and can be **run simultaneously** to stack your earnings.

### Honeygain üêù

This is the market leader and the most well-known name in the space. It features a clean UI, a stable application, and an excellent referral program.

* **How it Works:** Standard bandwidth sharing. It also offers an optional "JumpTask" mode for faster crypto payouts (in JMPT) with a permanent bonus on your earnings.
* **Payouts:** PayPal or JMPT.
* **Payout Threshold:** $20 (for PayPal) or almost instant (via JumpTask).
* **Bonus:** Get a **$3 starting bonus** when you sign up using the link below.
* **My Take:** A must-have. It's the most stable and popular. The JumpTask option is a fantastic addition for those interested in crypto.

### EarnApp üí∞

A major competitor, often cited as one of the most profitable depending on your location. It's known for its true "set it and forget it" simplicity.

* **How it Works:** Extremely simple setup. The app is lightweight and runs on a huge range of devices, including Raspberry Pi, making it perfect for a 24/7 dedicated device.
* **Payouts:** PayPal, Amazon Gift Cards.
* **Payout Threshold:** $2.50 (very low!).
* **Bonus:** Their referral program is also very generous.
* **My Take:** Excellent. Its key strengths are its wide compatibility (especially Linux/Raspberry Pi) and its very low payout threshold, allowing you to get your money fast.

### Pawns.app (formerly IPRoyal) ‚ôüÔ∏è

Also very popular, Pawns.app stands out by combining bandwidth sharing with other micro-tasks, such as taking surveys.

* **How it Works:** You can enable passive internet sharing, but also actively complete short surveys (availability depends on your profile) to boost your daily income.
* **Payouts:** PayPal, Bitcoin (BTC), and various Gift Cards.
* **Payout Threshold:** $5 (low and easy to reach).
* **Bonus:** Get a **$1 starting bonus** just for signing up.
* **My Take:** Perfect if you want a mix of "passive" and "active" earning. If you only use the passive part, it's still great. If you add a few surveys, you can hit the $5 payout very quickly.

## üåê Comprehensive List of Other Platforms

To further diversify your income, here are other legitimate services in this space. I do not use all of them as my primary earners, but they are well-regarded and can be great additions. (No affiliate links for this section).

* **Bitping:**
    * **Description:** This service is slightly different. It's a network monitoring service. Instead of sharing your bandwidth in bulk, your device runs micro-tests (like `ping` or checking if a website is up) from your specific location. You are paid a small amount for each successful test.
    * **Payout:** Cryptocurrency (primarily BSV).
    * **Note:** This is more of an "active-passive" earner. It's great for tech-savvy users who are comfortable with cryptocurrency payouts and want to contribute to network monitoring.

* **Grass (GetGrass.io):**
    * **Description:** A newer, very popular Web3 project. It's a decentralized network aiming to scrape public web data for training AI models.
    * **Payout:** Currently in a points-based beta. Points will be converted to a cryptocurrency upon the network's official launch.
    * **Note:** Very high potential, but it's a "bet" on a future crypto token, not a direct cash payout (yet).

* **Mysterium Network (MYST):**
    * **Description:** This is a fully decentralized Web3 project where you run a "Node" for their community-powered decentralized VPN (dVPN). Users pay you in crypto to use your IP address as a VPN exit node.
    * **Payout:** Exclusively in MYST cryptocurrency.
    * **Note:** This is for more advanced users. It's more technical to set up and requires some knowledge of crypto wallets. The earnings can be higher but are also more variable, depending on dVPN usage.

* **PacketStream:**
    * **Description:** One of the older players in this space. It operates on a peer-to-peer "marketplace" model where businesses and developers buy bandwidth directly from "Streamers" (you).
    * **Payout:** PayPal (from $5).
    * **Note:** Because it's a marketplace, earnings can be more variable than with other services that offer a fixed rate per GB. When demand is high, it can be profitable.

* **Peer2Profit:**
    * **Description:** A solid platform with a good reputation, particularly popular in regions outside of Western Europe and North America.
    * **Payout:** Wide range of cryptocurrencies and e-wallets (e.g., Payeer, Advcash, WebMoney).
    * **Note:** Great if you prefer non-PayPal or crypto payout options.

* **Repocket:**
    * **Description:** Another straightforward "set it and forget it" app for sharing your internet connection. It has a clean interface, a $5 sign-up bonus, and is available for multiple platforms.
    * **Payout:** PayPal (from $20).
    * **Note:** It's a solid, simple earner, very similar in operation to Honeygain or Pawns.app. A good one to add to your stack.

* **TraffMonetizer:**
    * **Description:** A simple and reliable application that pays you for your internet traffic. It's easy to set up and runs on Windows, Android, macOS, and Linux (Docker).
    * **Payout:** PayPal (from $10), Bitcoin, Payeer, and other options.
    * **Note:** A solid, simple-to-use earner that is a great addition to the main apps.

## üìà Strategies to Maximize Your Earnings

Installing one app on one PC will earn you a few dollars a month. To turn this into a noteworthy side income ($15 - $75+ / month), follow these strategies:

1.  ‚úÖ **Run ALL Main Platforms:** This is the golden rule. Run Honeygain, EarnApp, and Pawns.app *at the same time* on the same devices. They do not conflict.
2.  üíª **Use Multiple Devices:** Install the apps on every device you own: your desktop, laptop, an old Android phone in a drawer, etc.
3.  üåê **Use Multiple Unique IPs (The Key!):** This is the single most important factor. Services pay for *unique* IP addresses. If you have access to different networks (home, office, a family member's house), install the apps on a device at each location.
    * *Note: Most services only permit one account/device per single IP address to prevent fraud.*
4.  üí° **Use a Dedicated Device (Advanced):** The ultimate strategy is to use a low-power device, like a **Raspberry Pi** (or an old mini-PC), running 24/7/365. This is the definition of "passive." EarnApp and TraffMonetizer are particularly good for this.
5.  üåç **Location Matters:** Demand (and thus your rates) heavily depends on your country. IPs from the USA and Western Europe are typically in highest demand.
6.  ü§ù **Use Referrals:** Once you're signed up, use your own referral links. This is a powerful income multiplier.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings and Best Practices

* **Realistic Expectations:** This is a **side-hustle income**, not a salary. Think of it as a way to pay for your Netflix, Spotify, or a cup of coffee, all for zero effort.
* **Check Your ISP's ToS:** Read your Internet Service Provider's (ISP) Terms of Service. While this practice is legal, a few (rare) ISPs may have clauses against "reselling" your bandwidth.
* **Data Caps:** If your internet plan is not "unlimited" (e.g., a 4G/5G mobile plan), monitor data usage closely to avoid massive fees. All apps have settings to function only on Wi-Fi.
* **IP Reputation:** By sharing your IP, you carry a very small risk of it being used improperly. The services listed here have strict client-vetting processes, but zero-risk doesn't exist. It is not recommended to run these services if you host sensitive servers (like a business website) from your home.

## ‚ùì FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

**Q: Will this slow down my internet?**
A: No. These applications are designed to be non-intrusive. They only use bandwidth you are not actively using (typically capped at 10% of your total). You will not feel any difference when browsing, gaming, or streaming.

**Q: How much can I *really* earn?**
A: The most common question. The answer is: **it depends.**
Your income is based on 3 factors:
1.  **Your Location** (demand for your country's IPs)
2.  **Number of Devices**
3.  **Number of *Unique* IP Addresses**

A realistic estimate for a user in Europe/North America with 1 PC and 1 phone on a single IP is around **$5 - $15 per month** (running all main apps). Power users who optimize with multiple IPs and dedicated devices can reach **$50 - $100+ per month**.

**Q: Do these apps use a lot of power or CPU?**
A: Extremely little. They are lightweight and optimized to run in the background without impacting your device's performance.
